# 1-54 Festival 
This CLI application explores the artist and galleries being shown at the most recent 1-54 Contemporary African Art Festival New York Edition. In this add you can explore galleries and artist separately, an artist's representing gallery's, or a gallery's featured artist. T

## Motivation 
The 1-54 Festival is one of my favorite art festivals. The first time I went to the festival was one of my favorite memories to date. I wanted to give users the opportunity to explore and learn about some of the artist I saw when attending this festival, increasing their knowledge of different African artists and the galleries that represent them.
